# Azure-Services
Introduction of Azure Services: 

1. Virtual Machine: A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer, allowing multiple operating systems to run on a single physical host.
                    It uses a hypervisor to manage resources like CPU, memory, storage, and networking, isolating each VM for security and flexibility.

    -- Benefits: 
              Multi-OS Support: Run Linux on a Windows host, macOS on a PC, etc.
              Testing & Development: Experiment with software, OS versions, or configurations safely.
              Server Consolidation: Host multiple VMs (e.g., web server, database) on one physical server.
              Security: Isolate risky apps or malware for analysis.
              Portability: VMs can be saved as files, moved, or backed up.
              Cost Efficiency: Reduces need for multiple physical machines.

    -- Example Scenario:
             You’re a web developer with a Windows 10 laptop. You need to test a web application (e.g., a Python Flask app) on a Linux environment like Ubuntu,
             but you don’t have a second machine.Then you can use virtual machines available on cloud services.

   --Types of Virtual Machines (VMs):
               1. System Virtual Machines: These emulate a complete physical computer, including virtual CPU, memory, storage, and networking, allowing a full operating system
                                          (guest OS) to run on a host machine.It replicate the functionality of a standalone machine to run multiple OS environments on one physical device.
               2. Process Virtual Machine: These are designed to run a single application or process in an isolated, platform-independent environment, abstracting the underlying OS and hardware.
                                           It Provide a runtime environment for a specific program, shielding it from the host OS differences.
